# morphology
A morph organizing tool for Virt-a-Mate

# Installation
- download the [lastest release](https://github.com/morph1sm/morphology/releases)
- unzip into a folder somewhere
- run `Morphology.exe`

# Usage
- select a morph folder with the button on the top right (e.g. `/Vam/Custom/Atom` or drill deeper, if you like)
- wait until all regions and morphs are loaded
- select a region form the list on the left
- select one or more morphs from the list on the right dislaying the current regions morphs
- drag one or more morphs to any region
- keep going until you're happy with the region arrangement
- click the Apply Changes button to write all region changes out to the morph files (.vmi)
- if you want to abandon your changes, just select a new morph folder or close the tool

##Roadmap
- **v0.2** will have a way to add and rename regions and will be able to install DAZ .dsf morphs. The latter will just copy the DSF to the morph folder, but will change the region to whatever region you drop the DSF file on. So, essentially just saving you a step or two.
- **v0.3** will allow importing of .duf to .vap. This probably will be limited in what type of shape presets work. I'm still learning about this.
- **v0.4** Will add a way to mark morphs by license, i.e. a way to easily see what should be removed when you publishing a look.
